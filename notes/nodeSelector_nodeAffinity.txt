NodeSelector

Allows you to tell where to place a pod. Very limited when compared to Node Affinity

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metedata:
	name: worker-app-pod
	labels:
		name: worker-app-pod
		app: demo-voting-app
spec:
	container:
		- name: worker-app
		image: kodekloud/examplevotingapp_worker:v1
	nodeSelector:
		size: Large
		
		
This would tell the pod to be placed on a node with label "Large"

To place label on a node:
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
kubectl label nodes node-1 size-Large



Node Affinity

Ensure that pods are hosted on particular nodes

pod-definition.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metedata:
	name: worker-app-pod
	labels:
		name: worker-app-pod
		app: demo-voting-app
spec:
	containers:
		- name: data-processor
		image: data-processor
	affinity:
		nodeAffinity:
			requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
				nodeSelectorTerms:
					- matchExpressions:
						- key: size
						operator: In
						values:
							- Large
						OTHER OPTIONS
						- key: size
						operator: NotIn
						values:
							- small
				



Node Affinity types:
	Available:
		requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
			If it cannot find a pod with a label, then it will not be scheduled
		preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
	
	Planned:
		requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution
		preferredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution
