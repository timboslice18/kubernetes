Monitor Cluster Components

Tools:
	Metrics Server
		- 1 metrics server per kubernetes cluster.
		- Retrieves metrics from each node and pod, aggregates them and stores them in memory. This means you don't get historical info and should rely on the tools listed below:
		- Kubelet has a cAdvisor which is responsible for gathering and sending metrics from pod/nodes
		- minikube addons enable metrics-server
		- kubectl top node|pod ##see statistics
	Prometheus
	Elastic Stack
	Data Dog
	Dynatrace
