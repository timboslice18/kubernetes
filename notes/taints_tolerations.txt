This only tells the node whether to allow a pod or not. It does not tell a pod to be assigned to a node. 

You place a taint on a node to prevent a node from being assigned to it

	You then specify which pods are "tolerant" to be allowed to be placed on a tainted node
	
kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
